# Women's Fashion Chain Data Analysis

This repository contains the data analysis and pricing prediction code for categorizing products in a women's fashion chain of stores in the United States. The analysis involves examining various datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and applying machine learning models to predict pricing categories.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze product categories and pricing strategies for a women's fashion chain with over 700 stores in the US. By utilizing data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover insights into product categorization and develop a predictive model for pricing.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains raw and cleaned datasets used for analysis.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step data analysis, visualization, and model building.
- **`models/`**: Trained machine learning models for pricing prediction.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/womens-fashion-chain-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd womens-fashion-chain-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore the Jupyter notebooks for detailed analysis.
2. Run the notebooks in order to reproduce the analysis and models.

## Data Analysis Workflow

### 1. Product Dataset Analysis

- **Objective**: Understand the characteristics of the product dataset, including categories, pricing, and other key attributes.
- **Steps**:
  - Load and inspect the product dataset.
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
  - Visualize key metrics to gain insights into product distribution and pricing.

### 2. Store Dataset Analysis

- **Objective**: Analyze the store dataset to understand the distribution of stores and their attributes.
- **Steps**:
  - Load and inspect the store dataset.
  - Conduct EDA to explore store types, locations, and performance metrics.
  - Visualize store data to identify regional trends and sales performance.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Transformation

- **Objective**: Clean and preprocess the datasets for accurate analysis and model building.
- **Steps**:
  - Handle missing values and outliers.
  - Normalize and encode categorical data.
  - Merge datasets as needed to enrich the data for analysis.

### 4. Pricing Prediction

- **Objective**: Develop machine learning models to predict product pricing.
- **Steps**:
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) on the training data.
  - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

## Results

The analysis identified key product categories and their pricing strategies across different stores. The predictive models demonstrated an ability to accurately forecast product pricing based on various features.

- **Model Performance**:
  - Best model: Random Forest Regressor with an RMSE of X.
  - Insights: The models revealed that certain product features and store attributes significantly impact pricing.
